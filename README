README for HW4

Partners: Ryan Ghayour & Mateo Hadeshian

Architecture:
  compress40.c contains all compression and decompression, as well as all 
  printing, and reading bitmaps.
  
  40image.c contains the driver for the compression/decompression, reading
  the file and calling compression/decompression from compress40.c depending
  on command line arguments.

Makefile Usage:
  make 40image // makes executable of 40image.c

USAGE: 
  compression: ./40image -c [FILE] > [COMPRESSED] 
      // prints compressed to stdout

  decompression: ./40image -d [FILE] > [DECOMPRESSED]
      // prints decompressed image to stdout

Help Recieved:  We worked primarily alone, however we recieved lots of useful
        help from TAs with bugs that would have taken much longer to 
        solve alone, especially regarding our bitpacking and some 
        confusion about changes in variables.

What has been correctly implemented: 

  -c:

  - conversion from ppm to component video
  - converting component video 4 pixels into the 5 ints a, b, c, d, pb, pr.
  - packing the 5 int values into 32-bit words.
  - printing the words in big endian order to stdout in a comp 40 bitmap
    notation.

  -d:
  - readning in an array of 32-bit words from a comp 40 bitmap file.
  - unpacking each word of that array into 5 ints: a, b, c, d, pb, pr.
  - convert each each set of ints into 4 component-video pixels.
  - convert from component-video form to ppm format.
  - print image to stdout;
